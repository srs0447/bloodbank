        <h3>Blood Donation Process</h3>
        <p>Donating blood is a safe, simple, and rewarding experience that usually only takes 45-60 minutes.</p>
        <h4>Before You Donate</h4>
        <p> To donate blood, find a blood bank near you using AABB’s blood bank locator. Then, call the blood bank to make an appointment. When making the appointment, ask the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are your general donor requirements? (Most places require you to weigh a minimum of 110 pounds, be at least 16 years old and be generally healthy).</li>
          <li>What kind of identification is required? (First-time donors are usually asked to present two forms of identification—the type of identification needed varies by facility).</li>
          <li>If you have any particular health concerns or have traveled outside of the country, it’s also a good idea to inform the blood bank at the time you are making your appointment.</li>
        </ul>
